APIs ka kaam
APIs ka kaam hai frontend aur backend ke beech mein communication karna. Jaise:

Frontend: User kuch karta hai (e.g., product search, cart update).
Backend (API): Data save karna ya lana (e.g., database se products fetch karna).
Breakdown aur kaise use karna hai:
Fetch Products

Kya karega: Sare products ki list dikhayega (e.g., Home ya Listing Page par).
Kaise use karein:
Frontend API call karega /products ko (GET request).
API backend se data laake frontend ko bhejegi.
Fetch Product Details

Kya karega: Ek specific product ka detail dikhayega (e.g., Product Details Page par).
Kaise use karein:
Frontend API call karega /products/:id (GET request).
Backend se us ID ka product detail bhejega.
Create Order

Kya karega: Jab user "Place Order" kare, order ko database me save karega.
Kaise use karein:
Frontend /orders API par (POST request) data bhejega (e.g., cart items, user details).
Backend usse save karega aur response bhejega (e.g., order confirmation).
Fetch Orders by User

Kya karega: User ke purane orders ki list dikhayega (e.g., Order History Page).
Kaise use karein:
Frontend /users/:id/orders ko (GET request) call karega.
Backend user ID se orders fetch karke bhejega.
Order Tracking

Kya karega: Ek order ka status batayega (e.g., Delivered ya Shipped).
Kaise use karein:
Frontend /shipment/:id ko (GET request) call karega.
Backend us shipment ID ka status return karega.
Ab Implementation Plan ka kya matlab hai?
Pehle Core Features banao:
Wo cheezein jo user ko product browse karne aur order karne me help karein.

Frontend: Home, Product Listing, Product Details, Cart/Checkout pages.
Backend APIs: /products, /products/:id, /orders.
Sanity Schemas: Product aur Order ka data setup karna.
Secondary Features banao:
Wo cheezein jo extra convenience deti hain (e.g., Order History, Tracking).

APIs: /users/:id/orders, /shipment/:id.
Future Enhancements:
Baad me additional features add karo (e.g., Reviews, Advanced Filters).
