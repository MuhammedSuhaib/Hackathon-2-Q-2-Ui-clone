### **Key Workflows:**

1. **User Registration**:
   - **Flow**: 
     1. User visits the frontend (Next.js).
     2. User signs up by providing necessary details.
     3. Registration details are stored in **Sanity CMS**.
     4. A confirmation email is sent to the user.
   - **Components Involved**: Frontend (Next.js) ↔ Sanity CMS ↔ Email Service (for confirmation)

2. **Product Browsing**:
   - **Flow**:
     1. User views product categories on the homepage.
     2. The frontend makes a request to the **Product Data API** (powered by Sanity CMS).
     3. The API responds with the product data (e.g., images, descriptions, prices, etc.), which is displayed on the frontend.
   - **Components Involved**: Frontend (Next.js) ↔ Sanity CMS ↔ Product Data API (Sanity)

3. **Order Placement**:
   - **Flow**:
     1. User adds products to their cart.
     2. User proceeds to checkout.
     3. Order details (items, quantities, shipping info) are sent to **Sanity CMS**.
     4. Sanity stores the order data for future reference.
     5. User is redirected to the payment gateway for transaction processing.
   - **Components Involved**: Frontend (Next.js) ↔ Sanity CMS ↔ Payment Gateway API ↔ Order Data API

4. **Shipment Tracking**:
   - **Flow**:
     1. Once the order is processed, the **Third-Party API** (shipment tracking) is called.
     2. The API fetches the real-time shipment status (e.g., in transit, delivered).
     3. The frontend fetches and displays this information to the user.
   - **Components Involved**: Frontend (Next.js) ↔ Third-Party Shipment Tracking API ↔ User Device

5. **Payment Processing**:
   - **Flow**:
     1. The user enters payment details on the frontend.
     2. The frontend sends the payment data to the **Payment Gateway API** for processing.
     3. Upon successful payment, the confirmation is sent back to the frontend, and **Sanity CMS** records the payment and order status.
   - **Components Involved**: Frontend (Next.js) ↔ Payment Gateway API ↔ Sanity CMS

### **System Interaction Summary:**

- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Handles user interactions, product display, cart management, and payment processing.
- **Sanity CMS**: Manages product data, user data, and order records, acting as a backend for content and order management.
- **Third-Party APIs**: Provide external services such as shipment tracking and payment processing.
- **Product Data API**: Powered by Sanity CMS, this API provides product information to the frontend for browsing and selection.
- **Payment Gateway**: Securely handles transaction processing, allowing users to complete their purchases.

### **Data Flow in the System**:

1. **Product Browsing**: Frontend → Sanity CMS → Product Data API → Frontend (User sees products)
2. **Order Placement**: Frontend → Sanity CMS → Frontend (User confirms order) → Payment Gateway → Payment Confirmation
3. **Shipment Tracking**: Frontend → Shipment Tracking API → Frontend (User sees shipment status)

This architecture ensures that each component is responsible for specific tasks, and data flows smoothly between the frontend, backend (Sanity CMS), and third-party services (shipment tracking and payment gateways). By clearly defining these interactions, you can better plan the integration process and anticipate how different components will function together.
