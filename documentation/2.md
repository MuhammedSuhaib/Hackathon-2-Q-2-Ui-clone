#### **2. Design System Architecture**  
- Create a basic architecture diagram showing components and data flow.  

- Define workflows for product browsing, order placement, and shipment tracking.  

### 1. **Product Browsing Workflow**
   **Goal:** Allow users to efficiently search, explore, and find the products they want.

   **Steps:**
   - **Start Browsing:**
     - User lands on the homepage or product category page.
   - **Search for Products:**
     - User enters a keyword, selects a category, or applies filters (e.g., price range, brand, ratings).
     - System displays search results matching the query.
   - **Refine Search (Optional):**
     - User can apply more specific filters (e.g., color, size, delivery options).
     - System updates results based on filters.
   - **View Product Details:**
     - User clicks on a product to view detailed information such as images, specifications, reviews, and price.
   - **Add to Cart:**
     - User adds the product to their shopping cart.
     - System confirms that the product has been added to the cart.
   - **Continue Browsing or Proceed to Checkout:**
     - User can continue browsing or go to the cart to check out.

### 2. **Order Placement Workflow**
   **Goal:** Enable users to place an order and provide necessary details to complete the purchase.

   **Steps:**
   - **View Cart:**
     - User checks the items in their shopping cart.
   - **Proceed to Checkout:**
     - User clicks "Proceed to Checkout."
   - **Sign In/Sign Up (If Needed):**
     - User logs into their existing account or creates a new one.
     - System prompts for login details or account creation.
   - **Enter Shipping Information:**
     - User provides a shipping address (new or saved address).
     - System verifies the address format.
   - **Select Payment Method:**
     - User chooses a payment method (credit card, PayPal, etc.).
     - System validates payment information.
   - **Review Order:**
     - User reviews the order summary (items, quantities, shipping address, total cost).
     - System displays the final details for confirmation.
   - **Place Order:**
     - User submits the order.
     - System processes the payment and confirms the order placement.
   - **Order Confirmation:**
     - User receives an order confirmation on-screen and via email with an order number.

### 3. **Shipment Tracking Workflow**
   **Goal:** Let users track their orders post-purchase to monitor shipping and delivery status.

   **Steps:**
   - **View Order History:**
     - User navigates to the "My Orders" or "Order History" section.
   - **Select Order to Track:**
     - User clicks on the specific order they want to track.
   - **View Shipment Status:**
     - System shows the current status of the shipment (e.g., "Shipped," "In Transit," "Out for Delivery").
     - Includes tracking number and carrier information (e.g., UPS, FedEx).
   - **Track in Real-Time (Optional):**
     - If supported, the user can see real-time updates on the order’s location, including an estimated delivery time.
   - **Receive Notifications (Optional):**
     - User receives notifications via email or push notification regarding any status updates (e.g., shipment dispatched, out for delivery).

---

### Edge Cases and Error Handling:
- **Payment Issues:** If the payment fails, prompt the user to try again with a different method.
- **Out of Stock Products:** If an item goes out of stock after being added to the cart, notify the user and allow them to choose a similar item or remove it.
- **Incorrect Shipping Address:** If the shipping address is incomplete or invalid, prompt the user to fix it before proceeding.

These workflows break down the key stages and actions a user will take during product browsing, placing an order, and tracking 

### **3. Plan API Requirements**  
- List 3–5 key endpoints (e.g., `/products`, `/orders`, `/shipment`).  
Here’s a short and focused version of the key API endpoints for your e-commerce website:

1. **`/products`**
   - **Purpose:** Get a list of products or details about a specific product.
   - **Methods:** 
     - `GET /products`: List products.
     - `GET /products/{id}`: Get product details.

2. **`/orders`**
   - **Purpose:** Place new orders and view order details.
   - **Methods:** 
     - `POST /orders`: Place an order.
     - `GET /orders/{orderId}`: View order details.

3. **`/shipment`**
   - **Purpose:** Track the status of an order’s shipment.
   - **Methods:** 
     - `GET /shipment/{orderId}`: Get shipment status and tracking info.

4. **`/users`** (Optional)
   - **Purpose:** Manage user accounts (signup, login).
   - **Methods:**
     - `POST /users/signup`: Create an account.
     - `POST /users/login`: User login.

5. **`/cart`** (Optional)
   - **Purpose:** Add or remove items from the cart.
   - **Methods:**
     - `GET /cart`: View cart items.
     - `POST /cart/add`: Add item to cart.
     - `DELETE /cart/remove`: Remove item from cart.

These are the essential API endpoints for your e-commerce platform to handle product browsing, order placement, and shipment tracking.

- Define basic method, payload, and response for each endpoint.  


#### **4. Write Technical Documentation**  
- Briefly describe system architecture, workflows, and key APIs.  
- Add Sanity schema definitions (keep it simple: product, order, customer).  
**Time:** **2 hours**  

---

#### **5. Collaborate and Refine**  
- Review work with peers/cousins.  
- Get feedback on workflows, diagrams, and overall clarity.  
- Refine and finalize.  
**Time:** **1.5 hours**

### **Summary: 1-Day Plan**  


---

### **Non-Technical Help Tasks for Cousins**  
1. **Flowchart Creation**  
   - Help create architecture and workflow diagrams.  
   **Time:** 1 hour.  

2. **Proofreading and Formatting**  
   - Check documentation for grammar, clarity, and formatting.  
   **Time:** 30 minutes.  

---

**Tips for Success:**  
1. Stick to the timeline strictly.  
2. Delegate non-technical tasks to cousins while focusing on critical technical tasks.  
3. Avoid perfectionism—focus on functionality over fine details.
